description: A collection of old links from my Google Plus Account
tags: miscellaneous
---

One of the primary reason I started this blog was because I wanted a place to preserve personal learnings, as well as links to blog posts or articles I found particularly useful.  I had been keeping these on Google Plus, but because Google Plus is getting shut down I decided to use this as an opportunity to mess around with Jekyll and Github Pages. This is an unorganized collection of links to some of those articles.

The problem with keeping a collection of old links like this, without adding anything new, is that I can't guarantee that they'll stick around forever. Better would be to incorporate the relevant knowledge into a post of my own, which I plan on doing over time. Hopefully before the original articles aren't lost forever.

[Optimization Guide for Windows 8 on SSDs](https://www.overclock.net/forum/20-hard-drives-storage/1240779-sean-s-windows-8-install-optimization-guide-ssds-hdds.html)
: Okay, this one is really old, dating back to 2012. I have no idea if it's still relevant for Windows 10 or newer hardware.

[Password Reset with SimpleMembership](http://kevin-junghans.blogspot.com/2013/04/password-reset-with-simplemembership.html)
: I think all of this (or most of it) is baked into newer releases of ASP.NET MVC 5. I know that I had the ability to plug in a simple email service to a .NET Core 2.x app as part of the default scaffolding. Keeping it for posterity anyway.

[Resolve 404 in IIS Express for PUT and DELETE Verbs](https://stevemichelotti.com/resolve-404-in-iis-express-for-put-and-delete-verbs/)
: This was written for IIS 7, and the current version is IIS 10. I don't remember having to modify the allowed verbs, but keeping this anyway in case I need it.

[How to Enable Remote Connections in SQL Server 2008](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/walzenbach/2010/04/14/how-to-enable-remote-connections-in-sql-server-2008/)
: The latest version of SQL Server is 2017, so these instruction are quite old. As far as I'm aware, they're just a relevant.

[HTML5 Sortable](http://farhadi.ir/projects/html5sortable/)
: This doesn't have the same level of control that I wanted. I should follow up with my extended library in a dedicated post.
* Single line and multi-line drag-able items
* Fixed size 'containers' that prevent overflow past their container size
* Drag-able items that can move within their own container, but cannot move to a different container on the same page.
* CSS to help provide visual indicators for size of containers, size of items, and their "dragability" (anywhere, only here, and nowhere).

[Using Areas in an ASP.NET MVC App](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/areas?view=aspnetcore-2.2)
: The original link ([here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/aspnet/ee671793(v=vs.98))) I used was super old (MVC 3). The link above is for ASP.NET Core 2.2.
: Areas allow you to organize your code more fully, to allow multiple high level functional components to work independently. Each area has its own controllers, views, and models.

[Another Old Article on ASP.NET Areas](https://www.codeguru.com/csharp/.net/net_asp/mvc/article.php/c20227/Using-Areas-in-ASPNET-MVC-Application.htm)
: The name says it all. This is from 2012. I read through it briefly and most of it still seemed relevant.

[Successive Method Calls with Moq](https://haacked.com/archive/2010/11/24/moq-sequences-revisited.aspx/)
: The original link ([here](https://haacked.com/archive/2009/09/29/moq-sequences.aspx/)) was from 2009. Phil updated it in 2010.

HTTP/2
: Per the GitHub landing page, "HTTP/2 is a replacement for how HTTP is expressed 'on the wire.'"
* [HTTP/2 on Github](https://http2.github.io/)
* [HTTP2 for front-end web developers](https://mattwilcox.net/web-development/http2-for-front-end-web-developers)
* [HTTP/2 on IIS](https://blogs.iis.net/davidso/http2)

[VanillaJS](http://vanilla-js.com/)
: Vanilla JS. Need I say more?

[Load Local JSON file through Javascript](https://codepen.io/KryptoniteDove/post/load-json-file-locally-using-pure-javascript)
: I recently had a need to work with a big, complicated JSON object. Instead of working exclusively in an IDE, I found it quicker to develop on a static single-page application, using a local .json file with an example object. This article helped me load a local file as a json object to work with.
: Note: Google Chrome doesn't allow you to do this unless the file is running through a web server of some sort, even a basic Apache server is good enough.

[Unit Testing Anti-Patterns](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/333682/unit-testing-anti-patterns-catalogue)
: James Carr used to have a blog post on the topic, but [the link](http://blog.james-carr.org/2006/11/03/tdd-anti-patterns/) doesn't work anymore.

Using npm and Webpack in ASP.NET Core
: I am using Webpack in a couple of projects, but I still don't think I understand it well enough to consider myself anything but a novice. I've used several articles to get me started.
* [ASP.NET Core 2.0 and the End of Bower](https://wildermuth.com/2017/11/19/ASP-NET-Core-2-0-and-the-End-of-Bower)
* [Setting up ASP.NET Core in Visual Studio 2017 with npm, webpack, and TypeScript: Part II](http://leruplund.dk/2017/04/15/setting-up-asp-net-core-in-visual-studio-2017-with-npm-webpack-and-typescript-part-ii/)
* [Building the minimal ASP.NET Core MVC app with NPM and webpack – the 2.0 edition](https://blogs.taiga.nl/martijn/2017/11/24/building-and-asp-net-core-mvc-app-with-npm-and-webpack-asp-net-core-2-0-edition/)

[DOMException: The play() request was interrupted](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/06/play-request-was-interrupted)
: This is an occasional exception I've gotten when streaming music from home to work.
